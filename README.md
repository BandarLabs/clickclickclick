Currently supporting local models via Ollama (Llama 3.2-vision), Gemini, GPT 4o. The current code is highly experimental and will evolve in future commits. Please use at your own risk.

The best result currently comes from using GPT 4o/4o-mini as planner and Gemini Pro/Flash as finder.

#### How to install

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clickclickclick
cd clickclickclick
```

It is recommended to create a virtual environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### How to use

Put your model specific settings in config/models.yaml and export the keys specified in the yaml file.

## As CLI tool

Install the tool

```sh
pip install <repo-whl>
```

```sh
./click3 run open google.com in browser
```


### Setup

Before running any tasks, you need to configure your planner and finder models using the `setup` command:

```sh
python main.py setup
```

You will be prompted to choose the planner and finder models and provide any necessary API keys.

### Running Tasks

To execute a task, use the `run` command. The basic usage is:

```sh
pip install <repo-whl>
```

```sh
./click3 run <task-prompt>
```

#### Options

- `--platform`: Specifies the platform to use, either `android` or `osx`. Default is `android`.

  ```sh
  python main.py run "example task" --platform=osx
  ```

- `--planner-model`: Specifies the planner model to use, either `openai`, `gemini`, or `ollama`. Default is `openai`.

  ```sh
  python main.py run "example task" --planner-model=gemini
  ```

- `--finder-model`: Specifies the finder model to use, either `openai`, `gemini`, or `ollama`. Default is `gemini`.

  ```sh
  python main.py run "example task" --finder-model=ollama
  ```

### Example

A full example command might look like:

```sh
python main.py run "Open Google news" --platform=android --planner-model=openai --finder-model=gemini
```

## Use as an API

  "finder_model": "openai"
}'
```

#### Example Response:
